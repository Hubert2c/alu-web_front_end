# Flexbox Website Project

## üìñ Project Overview

This project is a responsive, multi-section website created using **HTML5** and **CSS3**. It focuses on using **Flexbox** for layout instead of older techniques like floating elements. The website includes structured sections such as:

- Hero Banner
- Services
- Works
- About Us
- Latest News
- Testimonials
- Contact
- Article Page

The project also demonstrates semantic markup, CSS best practices, and modular design using section-specific class names.
